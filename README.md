# leramiz-backend
A django backend for leramiz template at colorib.com

I have included several features which are as follows:
#listview
#detailview
#search functionality added
#working forms
#working apis created, some work remaining at frontend (ajax calls)
#some minor works remaining

To get started:

Create a virtual environment in your working directory
#python -m venv virtualenvironmentname

Activate your virtual environment
#virtualenvironmentname/Scripts/activate.bat

install requirements
#pip install -r requirements.txt

make necessary migrations
#python manage.py makemigrations

run the server
#python manage.py runserver
